# Lan_Tran
Lan_Tran is an app created to make translations between Lantuosir and English easy! 
Lantuosir is a constructed language that I created based on Latin (and it's variants)
& Bantu languages. The main influences are Spanish, English, and Yoruba. To use Lan_Tran
just input what you would like to translate. At this time, Lan_Tran supports 1 word translation
from English to Lantuosir. It is an essential tool to begin writing in the language and studying it.
