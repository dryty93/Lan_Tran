# Lan_Tran
Lan_Tran is an app created to make translations between Lantuosir and English easy! 
Lantuosir is a constructed language that I created based on Latin (and it's variants)
& Bantu languages. It is developed as a fantasy lingua franca for the African Diaspora.
The main influences are Spanish, English, and Yoruba. To use Lan_Tran
just input what you would like to translate in lower case letters without using
punctuation marks (I am still developing this part of the language).
At this time, Lan_Tran supports English to Lantuosir translation.
It is an essential tool to begin writing in the Lantuosir and studying it.
Note all words and phrases do not tranlsate exactly into Lantuosir. Some words
simply do not exist in the languages so be sure to check the dictionary within the main
file. An online dictionary will be available shortly.
